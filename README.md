#Potato Disease Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network.

Potato Disease Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks with Tensorflow,data augmentation, tf dataset.Dataset is images of potato leaves 
which consist of 3 classes namely Early blight,Late blight and healthy potatoes.
 
This project focuses to reduce the economic losses due to various diseases in potato plants. There are two common diseases know as Early blight and late blight which is caused by fungus and specific type of microorganism respectively .To deal with this issue, we can predict this at the earliest and take appropriate measures and prevent the economic loss.
By the help of Convolutional Neural Network, if we provide a picture of the leaves, the model will predict whether the leaf is  Early blight, Late blight or healthy potatoes.
